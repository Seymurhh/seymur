As part of a National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded research initiative, I helped design and develop an interactive Virtual Lab environment using **Unreal Engine**. This lab was created to support engineering and manufacturing education, offering students an immersive, hands-on experience in a fully simulated environment.

### üéØ Project Goals
The primary objective was to create a virtual space where students can interact with engineering design tools, fabrication equipment, and testing systems‚Äîwithout the need for a physical lab. The goal was to enhance accessibility, safety, and learning outcomes across various engineering courses.

### üß™ Virtual Lab Structure
The VR system consists of three interconnected spaces:

- **Design & 3D Modeling Room**: Students interact with CAD drawings, assemblies, and parts in 3D.
- **Manufacturing Shop**: Features simulations of additive, subtractive, casting, and forming processes.
- **Quality Control & Testing Room**: Allows students to perform simulated inspections and mechanical testing tasks.

### üîß My Role & Tools Used
- Built and optimized **interactive 3D environments** using Unreal Engine.
- Modeled equipment and environments using Blender and integrated assets with custom interactions.
- Developed realistic workflows for CNC machines, 3D printers, and mechanical testers.
- Ensured VR compatibility and usability in a classroom setting (supporting Oculus Quest and desktop VR).

### üöÄ Impact
- Enabled over 100 students to access complex manufacturing and testing processes virtually.
- Provided a **cost-effective and scalable alternative** to physical lab access.
- Improved student engagement and conceptual understanding in courses like **mechanical design, manufacturing processes, and materials testing**.
