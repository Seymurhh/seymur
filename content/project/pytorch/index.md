This study focused on modeling and experimentally validating the interface strength of Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs) manufactured using the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) process. Interface regions in multi-material parts are typically prone to stress concentrations and delamination, especially when abrupt transitions are used. This project aimed to reduce these weaknesses through graded transitions and computational modeling.

### üîç Objective
- Evaluate how gradient transition length impacts interfacial strength in FGMs.
- Compare experimental outcomes with FE-based predictions.
- Analyze the effects of fiber reinforcement on interface performance.

### üß™ Experimental Setup
Tensile specimens with different transition types‚Äîdirect, interlock, and continuous gradient‚Äîwere fabricated using ABS and CF/ABS composites. Gradients were varied from 5% to 100% of the gauge length.

- **Key Result**: Gradient transitions outperformed direct interfaces by up to **84% in tensile strength** and **15% in stiffness**:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

### üß† Computational Modeling
A three-scale homogenization framework was implemented:
- **Microscale**: Fiber orientation and morphology modeled using Representative Volume Elements (RVEs).
- **Mesoscale**: Captured interbead voids and material distributions.
- **Macroscale**: Applied graded material properties in a finite element solver to simulate stress and deformation.

> üìà *See page 113, Fig. 6.8 in the dissertation*: Predicted stress distribution at various gradient lengths shows clear reduction in stress concentrations in graded designs compared to sharp interfaces.

### üìä Summary of Achievements
- Developed a multi-scale modeling pipeline that accurately predicts interface strength.
- Demonstrated **optimal gradient transition (~10‚Äì30%)** for maximizing strength while minimizing stress buildup.
- Confirmed through microstructural analysis that mechanical interlocking between beads enhances adhesion at interfaces.

### üèÅ Outcome
This modeling approach provides a validated method for designing stronger, more reliable FGMs‚Äîparticularly useful for high-performance applications in aerospace, biomedical, and automotive industries.
