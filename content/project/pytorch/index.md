This study focused on modeling and experimentally validating the interface strength of Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs) manufactured using the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) process. Interface zones in multi-material printed parts often experience stress concentrations, cracking, or delamination, especially with abrupt material changes. This project aimed to address those issues by using gradient transitions and multi-scale numerical modeling to improve reliability.

### üîç Objectives
- Investigate how varying gradient transition lengths influence interface strength.
- Compare performance of direct vs. graded and interlocked transitions.
- Use simulation to predict stress fields and validate with experimental data.

### üß™ Experimental Design
Tensile specimens made from ABS and CF/ABS were printed with different interface geometries:
- Direct transition
- Interlock pattern
- Gradient transitions with lengths of 5%, 10%, 30%, and 100%

All samples were printed using 0/90 layups and tested under standard ASTM D638 conditions.

üìå **Result**: Gradient transitions improved tensile strength by up to **84%** over direct interfaces and improved stiffness by up to **15%**. Interlock patterns offered moderate gains but also introduced additional stress points at geometry transitions.

### üß† Modeling Approach
A three-scale homogenization framework was developed:

- **Microscale**: Captured fiber morphology and orientation using representative volume elements (RVEs).
- **Mesoscale**: Modeled interbead voids and composite behavior across layers.
- **Macroscale**: FE simulations of tensile specimens using graded material properties.

üìà *Figure 1*: Predicted stress distribution at various gradient lengths shows a clear reduction in interfacial stress concentrations in graded designs compared to sharp material transitions.

### ‚úÖ Key Findings
- Gradient transitions reduced interface failures and improved load transfer.
- 10‚Äì30% transition length yielded optimal strength/stiffness trade-offs.
- Model predictions closely matched experimental results, validating the FE implementation.

### üß™ Application
This research supports the use of voxel-based digital design and FFF printing for optimized FGM parts in **aerospace**, **automotive**, and **biomedical** applications where reliable multi-material bonding is critical.
