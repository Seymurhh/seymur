abstract: |
  This article reviews the latest progress and challenges in additive manufacturing of multi-material parts (MMAM). It summarizes key AM processes—such as material jetting, fused filament fabrication, and direct energy deposition—used for producing multi-material and functionally graded components. It also discusses material combinations, interface quality, gradient transitions, and application domains across biomedical, aerospace, automotive, and electronics industries.

summary: Comprehensive review of multi-material additive manufacturing processes, materials, interface issues, and applications.
