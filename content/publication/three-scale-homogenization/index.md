abstract: |
  This study presents a three-scale asymptotic homogenization framework to predict the effective mechanical properties of short carbon fiber (SCF) reinforced PLA composites fabricated via fused filament fabrication (FFF). Experimental samples were printed with different SCF weight fractions (5%, 7.5%, and 10%). Simulations were conducted with random and aligned fiber orientations using actual RVE geometries. The model accurately predicted Youngâ€™s moduli in the transverse direction, but bead-direction estimations were less accurate due to fiber misalignment.

summary: Multi-scale modeling of SCF-reinforced PLA composites with validation using experimental and RVE-based simulations.
