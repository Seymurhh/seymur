  This study focuses on the processing and mechanical characterization of short carbon fiber (SCF) reinforced polycarbonate (PC) composite materials using fused filament fabrication (FFF). Different SCF volume fractions (3–10%) and printing speeds were tested. Mechanical tests (tensile, flexural, compression, microhardness) and SEM analysis were conducted to evaluate performance. The work applies micromechanics and classical lamination theory to estimate Young’s modulus and uses ANOVA and RSM to determine the optimal processing parameters.

summary: Mechanical and microstructural evaluation of 3D-printed PC composites reinforced with short carbon fibers using FFF.
