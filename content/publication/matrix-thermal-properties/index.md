abstract: |
  This study investigates the thermal behavior of short carbon fiber-reinforced composites manufactured using material extrusion by varying the matrix material. While prior research focused heavily on fiber orientation and concentration, this work examines how different polymer matrices influence thermal stability and degradation. Thermal performance was evaluated using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), with findings highlighting matrix-driven differences in thermal degradation behavior and heat resistance.

summary: Effect of matrix material on thermal properties of SCF composites fabricated by extrusion-based additive manufacturing.
