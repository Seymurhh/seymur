abstract: This research explores the use of Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) to create polymer-based functionally graded materials (FGMs). Various gradients, material pairings, and transition techniques were evaluated for their effect on mechanical performance, interfacial strength, and manufacturing feasibility.

summary: Study on functionally graded polymer materials using additive manufacturing, focusing on mechanical characterization and interfacial behavior.
