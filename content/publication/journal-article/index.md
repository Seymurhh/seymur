abstract: |
  In this research study, the design and fabrication workflow of functionally graded materials (FGMs) were introduced using fused filament fabrication (FFF) process. Rigid polymers were mechanically characterized in three printing directions. Tensile strength and modulus of elasticity values for YZ and XY printing orientation specimens indicated similar results. Printing in the XZ direction showed poor strength values in comparison with other directions. Interface analysis with different transition patterns was accomplished and the advantage of gradient transition was achieved. Micrography of specimens was analyzed to investigate the internal structure and was used to validate test results. Statistical methods were applied to investigate the relationship between process and performance.

summary: Mechanical testing and interface analysis of functionally graded polymer materials fabricated by the FFF process.
